# Technical Challenge
Write modular shell scripts that automate the retrieval of data from a web endpoint (see above). Develop a script to download data files (e.g., owid-covid-data.csv), store files in time stamped directories, delete data copies that are more than three (3) days old.  Focus on the script modularity, security, and testing. Retrieve the entire JHU directory for this exercise.
# I have written a script in WSL(UBUNTU) so i prefer WSL
